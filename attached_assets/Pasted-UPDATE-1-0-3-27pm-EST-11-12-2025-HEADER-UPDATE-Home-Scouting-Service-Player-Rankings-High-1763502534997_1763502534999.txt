HEADER UPDATE: Home | Scouting Service | Player Rankings | High School Rankings | REMOVE Circuit Rankings ADD Merch Shop | Events | Contact 

I like to add media link for articles to post on X - can that be added under quick links and dash board to write articles?

Scouting Service link should be the page you created thats new looking with the history and general information with ratings charts and logos. The logo design on homepage with $1495 to purchase service. When click link to purchase package includes: Bullits: Top 750 High School Class > National Prospects in class of 2026-2030 > Top College Transfer Portal Prospects > Coverage of Carolinas, DMV,Peach State, Sunshine State, Lone Star, SoCal, NorCal, Mid-Atlantic, Rocky Mountains and Heartland (NOTES) $1495 / year quanilty make sure they can only select 1 time remove + Buttion if you can. in past they have hit multiple times and had to refund which is pain in butt.

REMOVE: Change Elite Basketball Scouting Serivces CHANGE TO: Where College Coaches & Players Connect 

Player Rankings link can you have the photos in a Circle with Face Image? maybe spinning? or eye popping look High School Rankings same in circle with there logo too
